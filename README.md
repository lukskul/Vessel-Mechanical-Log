# Getting Started with Vessel Mechanical Log

## This Project is being built.  Try and Visit later... 

This Repository is designed to Add to or Edit Styles and Javascript for the Vessel Mechanical Log.

This Server.js is saving data locally into data/vessels.json and language/**.js files. This is for testing purposes only.  The real app Hosted on Heroku is using Vessels repository.  

*Any changes to Languages folder needs to be updated manually to Vessels Languages folder for real world use.

## Things To do: 
        1. Translate archive data to en or es. 
        2. return button bug.  
                In Zinc form click plus then return button and go back into zinc form and you can not click plus anymore.  
        3. informationButton class     
                informationButton css is in shaft.css that should be moved to a global folder, since it looks cool and other forms are using it. 

This Repository is strictly controlling the Script and Style functionality and all pushed changes into github will instantly translate to the Heroku Site.
